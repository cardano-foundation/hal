# 2025-12-01 Weekly Meeting

See [README](README.md) for explanations on how to read these minutes

Use: ✅ 🟠 🔴

## Planned last week

* @notunrandom
  - db-server:
    * ✅ explore db-analyzer snapshots, db-immutaliser and snapshot-converter
    * ✅ re-listen to recording of Javier/Arnaud meeting
    * ✅ start coding
  - ✅ homebrew: upgrade cardano-node formula to ~~10.5.3 patch~~ 10.6.1

* @abailly
  - ✅ amaru: better AT tests
    - tests are now running in CI
  - 🔴 help @notunrandom on db-server?
  - ✅ work w/ @paolino on adversary
  - 🔴 reach out to Martin Kourim to integrate cardano-node tests in AT
  - 🟠 reproduce network fork in AT (managed to reproduce locally on docker cluster but not integrated in AT)

* @paweljakubas
  - preparing presentation for Galway
  - work w/ @paolino on proofs?

* @paolino
  - 🔴 cardano-n2n-client:
    - make sure it has a good enough interface to serve cardano-utxo-csmt needs
    - write some tests
  - cardano-utxo-csmt
    - write some more CLI interface
    - 🟠 write docs, especially documenting how proof of (all) utxos at an address (PoUA) could work
  - 🔴 PoUA
      - write properties
      - implement
      - benchmark, this could bring some bad surprises as my proposed solution breaks the assumption of optimally sparse key space
  - csmt:
    - ✅ support for plain keys
    - ✅ support query internal nodes
    - write a property test about proof of exclusion and document how it should be implemented
    - write benchmarks for
      - deletion
      - proof generation
      - proof validation (this is mostly irrelevant as proofs will be generally validated with clients code)
    - write the HTTP interface, this is strictly not necessary as we only use csmt as a library, but the CLI is not telling all the truth (streaming is easy with CLI)
  - adversary:
    - ✅ understand what to do with Johannes branch with @abailly: merged
    - see how much of the cardano-n2n-client is really useful for other applications and decide if to use the lib or not
  
## Plan for this week

* @notunrandom
  - learn to use Amaru snapshot importer
  - keep experimenting with db-analyser and snapshot-converter
  - if experimenting successful, package db-analyser and snapshot-converter in
    Homebrew
* @abailly
  - wrap-up work on injecting txs and inducing fork in docker ardversary for use in AT
    - also write a detailed account of the experiment
  - prepare talk on PBT
  - engineering workshop in Galway 
* @paolino
  - fix scheduled cardano-node-antithesis tests
  - progress on PoUA
  - start N2N block fetching code for cardano-utxo-csmt
## Later

* @abailly
  - prepare offboarding
