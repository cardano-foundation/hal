See [README](README.md) for explanations on how to read these minutes

## Last week's plan

* @notunrandom:
  * âœ… trying working with MPFS/anti-cli
  * âœ… Cardano Academy course
  * ðŸŸ  looking at Advice process documents (and how to move them to GH/Code repo?)
* @paweljakubas:

  * ðŸ”´ (optional) KES merged to pallas
  * ðŸ”´ documentation of anti cli
* @paolino:
  * âœ… mpfs server

* @abailly:
  * âœ… complete connect 2 amaru nodes
  * ðŸŸ  secure funding for antithesis
  * ðŸŸ  external feedback about mpfs/pop

## Check

* @paolino
  * more work on server
  * provides local signing capabilities
  * some worries:
    * submission is open bar, annoying to keep this public
* @paweljakubas
  * short week (3 days)
* @anviking
  * adversarial node barely started
  * considering building the adversarial node in Rust!!
    * Haskell needs nix, need right C libraries to build deps
    * Q about Rust dependencies on C libs -> does not use them
  * Q: do we have some design of the adversarial node?
    * first step: chain sync "randomly" jumping
    * second step: tx injection
  * anti cli alignment w/ the team
* @notunrandom
  * `nix develop` (still running after > 3 hours)
  * proposing template for readme
* @abailly
  * working w/ amaru treasury script

## Act

* fill in slide deck during the week + dry run next Monday
* setup shared chat w/ Radicle -> check with Ele
  * Zulip would be better as it adds another evaluation point
  * sticking to a public channel seems better, we can always revert to private channel if needed

## Plan

* @notunrandom:
  * Start coding on anti-cli (pair up or get assigned an issue)
  * Create handbook and improve READMEâ€™s inspired by what I need(ed)
  * Prepare short Radicle presentation for 2nd July
  * Continue Academy
* @abailly:
  * draft slide for 2nd July
  * focus on Amaru demo for Friday
  * test MPFS for storing documents on IPFS
* @anviking:
  * anti cli
  * prepare for demo
  * look at log property failing because of log rotation
* @paweljakubas:
  * anti cli
  * prepare for demo
* @paolino:
  * MPFS w/ antithesis agent
  * write some doc/website as part of demo
