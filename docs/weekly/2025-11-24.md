See [README](README.md) for explanations on how to read these minutes

Use: ✅ 🟠 🔴

## Planned last week

* @notunrandom
  - ✅ db-server: explore db-synthesizer/db-analyzer
  - ✅ document (in hal) the Homebrew process & tips: [see new document](../homebrew.md)

* @abailly
  - ✅ Amaru antithesis / GHA
  - ✅ Engineering Show


## Plan for this week

* @notunrandom
  - db-server:
    * explore db-analyzer snapshots, db-immutaliser and snapshot-converter
    * re-listen to recording of Javier/Arnaud meeting
    * start coding
  - homebrew: upgrade cardano-node formula to 10.5.3 patch

* @abailly
  - amaru: better AT tests
  - help @notunrandom on db-server?
  - work w/ @paolino on adversary
  - reach out to Martin Kourim to integrate cardano-node tests in AT

* @paweljakubas
  - preparing presentation for Galway
  - work w/ @paolino on proofs?

* @paolino
  - cardano-n2n-client:
    - make sure it has a good enough interface to serve cardano-utxo-csmt needs
    - write some tests
  - cardano-utxo-csmt
    - write some more CLI interface
    - write docs, especially documenting how proof of (all) utxos at an address (PoUA) could work
    - PoUA
    - write properties
    - implement
    - benchmark, this could bring some bad surprises as my proposed solution breaks the assumption of optimally sparse key space
  - csmt:
    - write a property test about proof of exclusion and document how it should be implemented
    - write benchmarks for
    - deletion
    - proof generation
    - proof validation (this is mostly irrelevant as proofs will be generally validated with clients code)
    - write the HTTP interface, this is strictly no necessary as we only use csmt as a library, but the CLI is not telling all the truth (streaming is easy with CLI)
  - adversary:
    - understand what to do with Johannes branch with @abailly
    - see how much of the cardano-n2n-client is really useful for other applications and decide if to use the lib or not
