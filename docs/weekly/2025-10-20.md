## 2025-10-21 - Planning for anti-cli

* Ops, discussion with Livio Kopp:
  * 2 machines allocated w/o support
  * parallel effort w/in CF => hosting Blockfrost API
  * handing over at some point to run on mainnet
  * some work to do to ease operation
* MPFS has 2 users
  * "operator" -> controls agent & oracle
  * users of AT -> need to expose service -> need some leadership decision
  * plutimus.com will keep being the public facing API
* short term goal:
  * dashboard to monitor the 3 service for `Preprod` deployed on CF infra
  * Continuous deployment pipeline
* would be great if devs from the CF use it
* Demo agenda:
  1. What's antithesis?
  2. Demo anti-cli
  3. Talk about architecture & on-chain data
  4. Point people at more resources (website, documentation, source code...)
* Gaps on anti-cli?
  * have a way to find own tests, navigate data

* GHA useful for other teams? => nice to see if the result is green or not
  * => don't have to use anti-cli if green

* documentation?
  * @paweljakubas @paolino demo w/ asciinema -> use same script as demo
  * @notunrandom @abailly polish the web site ->
    * split user guide & operation guide, distinguish b/w end user and maintainers
    * hint at other AT customers' deployment
* web site:
  * remove references to nix => move to CONTRIBUTING
  * @paolino @abailly add a dashboard page listing all the facts from MPFS + link to the smart contract's address
* Ops/GH integration:
  * @anviking -> finishing integration in GHA
  * setting up monit app
  * setup infra process for hosting on CF
  * document deployment process
