# 2025-08-25 Weekly Meeting

See [README](README.md) for explanations on how to read these minutes

Use: âœ… ðŸŸ  ðŸ”´ 

## Last week's plan

* @abailly:
  * âœ… Amaru stuff
  * ðŸŸ  Move forward adversary

* @paolino
  * ðŸŸ  agent operations (generate-assets, test-run-locally, push-test) 

* @anviking:
  * ðŸ”´ Work with Paolo on test-run-locally and push-test 
  * Not the recorded plan:
    * ðŸŸ  Pairing and then mostly get local setup working adversary 
    * ðŸŸ  Investigate failures with Paolo 

## Check, show & tell

* Manage to have interactive secrets in the setting phase
  * problem with optparse-applicative is that you cannot do IO which precludes the possibility of extracting stuff from some other context
  * also o-a does not nicely support environment variables
* eventually converge error -> seems like the sidecar container is partitioned although it should not be there

## Act

* Write down design decisions about why we choose a different approach to argument parsing for anti-cli
  * contrast/compare with cardano-addresses?
* We should ensure we go to node diversity meetup "green"
  * fix sidecar partition?
  * remnove spurious AT errors
* Discussion about reworking eventually converged
* Who wants to join Node Diversity workshop?

## Plan

* @abailly
  * Pair/Mob on Adversary
  * Connecting Amaru to a tesnet (and run in AT if god permits)

* @paolino
  * Complete agent commands 
    - test-run-locally
    - push-test

* @anviking:
  * Pairing/work on adversary
  * Pairing/work on agent commands

* @paweljakubas:
  * Merge KES PR in Pallas -> bump version, then bump Amaru
  * fork dalek crypto in pragma-org

* @notunrandom:
  * documentation on anti-cli
  * continue adversary node
