  * handing over at some point to run on mainnet
  * some work to do to ease operation
* MPFS has 2 users
  * "operator" -> controls agent & oracle

  * plutimus.com will keep being the public facing API
* short term goal:
  * dashboard to monitor the 3 service for `Preprod` deployed on CF infra
  * Continuous deployment pipeline
* would be great if devs from the CF use it

  1. What's antithesis?
  2. Demo anti-cli
  3. Talk about architecture & on-chain data
  4. Point people at more resources (website, documentation, source code...)
* Gaps on anti-cli?
  * have a way to find own tests, navigate data
* GHA useful for other teams? => nice to see if the result is green or not
  * => don't have to use anti-cli if green
* documentation?
  * @paweljakubas @paolino demo w/ asciinema -> use same script as demo
  * @notunrandom @abailly polish the web site ->
    * split user guide & operation guide, distinguish b/w end user and maintainers

* web site:
  * remove references to nix => move to CONTRIBUTING
