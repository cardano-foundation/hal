## Check

* @paolino
  * good week on MPFS work
  * confused with async/await in TS, esp. when it comes to refactoring. TS is still useful
  * AB: maybe worthwhile to check https://effect.website
  * no need to use TS in the long run? used TS because of initial backend
  * leverage Ogmios API to index events on the smart contract address from chain and update the DB
  * PW: token owner should be able to retract requests? perhaps useful for fending off DoS attacks
* @paweljakubas
  * testing MPFS stuff
  * KES PR up with CLI
* @abailly
  * making progress on Bumping C-W to use 10.4.1
  * still quite a lot of puzzles on how to improve the way we use AT
  * contributed to [aiken docs](https://aiken-lang.org/example--hello-world/end-to-end/cardano-cli)
* @anviking
  * Mon-Tue not great, more progress on Wed
  * Requested adding node logs to the run's artifacts
  * not sure what's going on...
  * add more properties which are easier to fulfill?
  * PV: aren't we using the wrong view point?

## Act

* Reflect on Antithesis work and identify next steps
  * Perhaps our current focus on expressing properties through the
    logs is not that fruitful, or too complicated at this stage, and
    we want to do something else?
* Engineering team wide presentation on July the 2nd

## Plan

* @abailly
  * complete blog post about AT+MPFS work
  * connect 2 Amaru nodes
  * implement Simulation testing for Amaru consensus
  * help with AT work to clarify next steps (with @anviking)
* @paweljakubas
  * VRF part close to merging
  * Anti CLI
  * More testing on MPFS (with @paolino)
* @paolino
  * specify MPFS "protocol" (with @abailly)
  * separate wallet functionality from service
  * implement handling of rollbacks in the MPFS (with @paweljakubas)
* @anviking
  * define "smaller" properties to check with tracer
  * adding logs as artifacts for each AT run
  * merge [PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/antithesis/pull/15)
