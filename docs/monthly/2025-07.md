# Plans for July 2025

Monthly plans for the HAL Team

## Antithesis

* ðŸ”´ build adversarial node
  * talk w/ @ch1bo about his use case for an adversarial node
  * should we do it in Rust vs. Haskell? => Might be nice to flex Rust muscles, check [Amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/blob/d9eb4b8810b45e96d8167854ee8ffa79b6d90265/crates/amaru/src/stages/pull.rs#L80) for N2N connection using current pallas-network
  * Objective is to have a first simple test as discussed w/ consensus team with a node randomly doing short chainsync connection sessions. The main complexity is in maintaining information about intersection points, possibly trying to sync up at random points in the past to stree the nodes
* âœ… shepherd [Chris' PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/antithesis/pull/20) testing Dingo in a cardano-node cluster
  * run a an AT test against this cluster
  * ðŸŸ  talk to Antithesis team about making result page publicly accessible (SSO only to trigger tests and debugging sessions?)

## MPFS

* ðŸŸ  polish and publish the documentation (see `rad patch diff af46c61 --revision 051005a`)
  * ðŸŸ  get feedback from people in CF
  * â†’ https://mpfs.plutimus.com/api-docs/
* semantics of the request/validation
  * use JSON schemas to validate/show transactions' content
* ðŸ”´ Explore other use cases:
  * package manager for smart contracts, talk to filip
* âœ… MPFS currently in a reasonably stable state
  * ðŸ”´ Giving back money to people (aka. tokenomics for MPFS)

## Process

* ðŸŸ  documentation of our current ["state-of-the-art"](https://abailly.github.io/posts/discussion-of-the-method.html)
  * for each part of the process, either it's in the docs and it's moved to the hal repo or a new document is created in this repository
* âœ… involve @notunrandom in more development tasks

## Anti CLI

* ðŸ”´ design AT protocol to request/run tests over MPFS -> whole team
  * define the data to be stored/retrieved in MPFS
  * and _document_ it :)
* âœ… complete the full lifecycle of the CLI
* ðŸ”´ talk w/ Chris about using anti cli to trigger more runs
* ðŸ”´ help Amaru team (Stevan? Pascal?) define docker compose for Amaru and potentially run tests in AT

## Crypto libs

* âœ… Keep an eye on [VRF PR](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/377)
* ðŸŸ  merge VRF and KES libraries back to pallas when ready
  * Waiting for release

## Cardano wallet

* ðŸ”´ Complete https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/pull/5074 which is probably needed for https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet/pull/5073 which is needed to keep CI green
