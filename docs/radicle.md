# Radicle Evaluation

## Agenda

* Date: 2025-06-18
* List positive/negative points from each team member
* Decide how we are going to use it moving forward (ditch, use it for some projects, use it for all projects, ...)

## Individual feedback

### @paweljakubas

* really love the idea, full decentralisation
* like the CLI, overall decomposition of workflow makes sense, maps naturally to "real work" and everything needed
* it works (!)
* feel the CLI was very well designed
* enthusiastic becaucse it maps closely with what the team is focused on (supporting decentralise OSS developement)
* could be perfected, good enough to continue working with
* tutorial (eg. [user guide](https://radicle.xyz/guides/user)) well written
* ðŸ’˜ the roadmap, seems like a serious competitor for GH in the future

### @notunrandom

* it's fine to use it, do not use all of GH's stuff (PRs, reviews, whatever...)
* fine to start using it for "political" reasons
* Question about adoption -> if we strive for adoption we might want to be more visible
  * discoverability
  * familiarity of tool (or lack thereof) makes a big difference if you're one of the big OSS platforms
* same effort to learn GH and Rad
* happy to use it but no a neutral decision when it comes to adoption and visibility
  * could setup a push mirror to GH but does this make sense anyway?
  * would people contribute if GH is a mirror?
* couple of weird UI things, discovered new stuff working w/ Pawel
  * eg. who's working on what using names instead of ids
* playing the role of an external potential contributor -> not seeing who the authors are is not great
  * not everybody is going to be a delegate
* pain points are not problematic, used to work w/ CLI
* if we decide to use Radicle we should not be doing partially
  * Would be painful to switch between tools
* if we think we need GH features, then we should be using GH (doh!)

### @anviking

* I like CLI a lot
* fine working on a small project, would have missed comments on PRs if working on a larger project
* we might isolate ourselves outside of GH
* cognitive overhead working w/ Rad and switching GH
* ssh forward agents on GH is a nicer UX than having multiple identities on multiple machines

### @abailly

* I like the concept, and I would love to push it for "political" reasons
* CLI is well polished, provide all you need work comfortably
* working in a team feels a bit more awkward
  * it's hard to review/comment on patches, or rather it's hard to have a good overview
  * UX is better on the app but then you lose the nice CLI workflow
* the team is very responsive on their Zulip chat (again, that's an "isolated" medium :) )
* the workflow needs to be very different than the usual PR based workflow
  * using patches as PRs is probably not the right way to do it
  * might be better for fully OSS projects
  * might not even be suited for TBD

### @paolino

* protocol is fine, information is there but UI is not there
* review process does not allow reviewing specific line
  * possible with an app but does not work when working remotely
* want to have the freedom to use the CLI
* don't like GH so it solves the problem of not using GH
* different opinion about GitLab
* we don't need this type of platform, perhaps it's a matter of making Radicle better?
* working on a decentralised protocol (Cardano) aligns nicely with the philosophy of Radicle
* one positive aspect: hosting of the projects' code is much less
  centralised and removes the ambiguity of having the code "owned" by
  individuals vs. organisation (eg. CF org in GH can be at odds with
  how people work and other organisation)

## Outcome

* Proposal 1: Not using at the moment but share our experiment with the rest of
  the engineering team (use our Demo slot on 2025-07-02) and try to get
  more traction from the organisation in order to avoid isolating
  ourselves
  * => prepare some presentation for July 2nd and/or share some documentation
* Proposal 2: Keep using Radicle for antithesis CLI as there's a good
  possibility both could work well together, and provide feedback to
  Radicle team (or even possibly contribute?)
* Proposal 3:

**Decision**:
    1. we keep using it for the next couple of weeks
    2. @notunrandom will prepare a demo/presentation for the 2nd of July to get buy-in from the organisation
