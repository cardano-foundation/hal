# Asynchronous communication

What did we learn from Darren Murph’s presentation?  
Do we want to adopt some of his recommendations?  
How do we start?

## Shared platform

> All projects must start in a shared platform. That was a system to ensure
> that there was a single point of entry for all work projects, regardless of
> function.

- We already use shared platforms for everything  
- Do we use too many?  
- Do we have a single point of entry?  
- Is the documentation curated? Up-to-date?  
- Can we get by without needing to ask someone?  
- Do we have a document of team conventions ? (git workflow, what tools we use,
  naming conventions, code conventions, documentation conventions)

Possible improvements:

- Have a single point of entry, at least for HAL (this repository's README.md)
- Delete duplicated and obsolete project management documents

## Low context communication

> Assume your audience has no-to-low context

- Do we do this at all?

## Meetings

> “No agenda, no attenda.”  
> “Taxonomy: collaborating and informing are the easiest to do asynchronously”
> “If you are spending sync time collaborating and informing, that is time you
> are not connecting or innovating”.

- @notunradom's calendar has 50% of meetings with no agenda, and almost all fall
  into the category of recurring (weekly or monthly) meetings either for status
  updates or just informing.

## Structured brainstorming

- Do we do this at all?

Suggestion:

- Try it out on Radicle decision (rather than have a meeting)

## Operating principles and bias toward asynchronous

- Is there any evidence that management endorses asynchronous communication?  
- As a team, do we want to practice it?  
- Who organized Darren Murph’s presentation and why?

## Foundational to be best-in-class

> 1. Great at writing in detail  
> 2. Memos over meetings: meetings are a last resort  
> 3. Great at honouring company’s handbook taxonomy  
> 4. Great at documenting decisions

- When we hire, do we investigate writing ability?  
- Do we care about quality of writing (do we review it, discuss it, improve it?)  
- Do we (CF or team) even have a handbook?  
- Do we even use memos?  
- Do we document decisions?  
- The annual team building offsite rewards classic extrovert behaviour  
- The monthly CF team meeting rewards classic extrovert behaviour
