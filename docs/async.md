# Asynchronous communication

The engineering team was given a presentation by Darren Murph, in June 2025,
about asynchronous communication.

In a nutshell, asynchronous communication is a way of collaborating that
maximises what team members can do asynchronously in order to spend precious
synchronous time on the most valuable things.

For example, the following should be done asynchronously:
- sharing information
- status updates
- problem-solving

While the following would be the best things to spend synchronous time on:
- connecting
- innovating
- decision making

This culture notably requires:
- using shared platforms for everything
- a very high focus on quality documentation

This document takes stock of the HAL team's current practice in those respects
and identifies possible improvements that the team wishes to make.

For more details about asynchronous working, see the [GitLab handbook][GitLabHB]

## Shared platform

We already use shared platforms for everything. It's possible that we use too
many, so that it is not always clear where to put/find something

We currently use:

- E-mail: this is the CF's official primary medium for internal communcations.
  We also have a team e-mail address (hal@cardanofoundation.org).
- Slack: the CF's second medium, for more instant messaging. Also used a little
  with outside parties.
- Discord for communicating outside of the team.
- GitHub and/or Radicle to store Git repositories (which include documentation
  and open-source collaboration tools e.g. issue tracking, pull requests etc.)
- Miro (a bit?)
- Google Drive (used to store process/team related documents, still useful for
  corporate stuff, presentations?)
- Sometimes https://forum.cardano.org

## Low context communication

> Assume your audience has no-to-low context

This is something we can improve on.

Cf. [Suggested Improvements](#suggested-improvements).

## Meetings

> “No agenda, no attenda.”  
> “Taxonomy: collaborating and informing are the easiest to do asynchronously”
> “If you are spending sync time collaborating and informing, that is time you
> are not connecting or innovating”.

- @notunradom's calendar has 50% of meetings with no agenda, and almost all fall
  into the category of recurring (weekly or monthly) meetings either for status
  updates or just informing.

## Structured brainstorming

We tend to brainstorm synchronously.

## Operating principles and bias toward asynchronous

At the present time the CF does not endorse the asynchronous communication approach.

The HAL team may nevertheless use it where possible to improve its internal work process.

## Foundational to be best-in-class

> 1. Great at writing in detail  
> 2. Memos over meetings: meetings are a last resort  
> 3. Great at honouring company’s handbook taxonomy  
> 4. Great at documenting decisions

There is room for improvement.

## Suggested short term improvements

1. Make the README.md in the hal repository a good single point of entry, from
   which everything else can be reached.

1. Curate process-related documentation and move from Google Drive to markdown
   docs in the hal repository.

1. Improve project README's by using the new template as a guide. In
   particular, assume the audience has no or little context.

1. Add other templates (CONTRIBUTING.md, ...)

1. Start a handbook describing how the HAL team works, including git workflow,
   preferred tools, coding conventions, etc.
