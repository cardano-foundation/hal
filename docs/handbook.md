# HAL team handbook

HAL is the Cardano Foundation's High Assurance Lab.

This handbook documents the ways in which we work.

## Organisation

The team's leader is Arnaud Bailly.

The team holds a weekly planning meeting every Monday morning (cf.
./weekly/README.md)

Arnaud holds a weekly one-to-one with each team member.

The team has a private Slack channel for day-to-day collaboration. Daily, every
member of the team writes what they plan to work on (and whether they need
something from other team members).

## Communication and collaboration

Since the team is geographically distributed, and essentially develops
open-source software:

- we aim enable an asynchronous, non-linear working style (cf. ./async.md)
- we aim to have as much as possible of our work products and processes public
  and in code repositories.

## Product management

The team works on several products (tools, libraries, ...)

Who is in charge of each product ?

## Code repositories

Currently we use both GitHub and Radicle.

The list of repositories we work on is in ../README.md

### Choosing a repository

Where do we put code ?

- in a new repository or in an existing repository?
- if new, where does it go?

### Git workflow

Each team member is free to use Git through a tool of their choice.

Workflow:

- TBD

### Code

they code editors.
